    "# Project : Weekly Task & Habit Tracker\n",
    "## Overview of the Project\n",
    "In this project, you will develop a Weekly Task & Habit Tracker using Python. This tool will help users track their tasks and habits throughout the week, allowing them to efficiently manage and monitor their daily routines and progress. Whether for personal use or as a professional productivity tool, this project will empower you to create a highly functional, interactive application using fundamental programming concepts in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task tracker will allow users to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add tasks to specific days of the week and being able to mark them as completed.\n",
    "- Add and track daily habits (such as exercise, water intake, reading, etc) and mark them as completed.\n",
    "- Remove tasks or habits when no longer needed.\n",
    "- View progress reports for both tasks and habits over a weekly or daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of the Project\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective task and habit tracking application. Through this, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience in developing Python applications with user input, loops, and conditionals.\n",
    "- Understand how to manage and manipulate data structures like dictionaries and lists to store and process data.\n",
    "- Learn how to design and implement interactive user interfaces in a command-line environment.\n",
    "- Develop a deep understanding of code modularity and best practices for organizing Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "Your project will be evaluated on the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality**: The application should be fully functional, allowing users to add, remove, and mark tasks or habits as complete, as well as generate reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Organization**: Code should be well-structured, with clear, meaningful variable names and appropriate use of functions. The overall organization should make it easy to extend or modify the program in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Experience**: The application should be easy to use, with clear instructions, error handling, and appropriate feedback for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Ensure all features are implemented as described and that the program runs smoothly without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creativity**: The application should be developed with an eye toward user experience. Feel free to enhance the application with additional features such as custom messages or additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will have developed a working task and habit tracker in Python, an excellent demonstration of your ability to apply programming skills to practical scenarios. You will also gain insights into software design, data management, and the development of tools that are both useful and efficient."

    "## Part 2: Add Tasks and Habits\n",
    "Build functions that let users add tasks to specific days and habits for the entire week.\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. **Create a function to add tasks:**\n",
    "- Ask the user which day they want to add the task to.\n",
    "- Make sure to validate the day. Display a message if the day was invalid.\n",
    "- Ask for the task name.\n",
    "- Store it in the dictionary you created to store tasks under the correct day.\n",
    "- Set the task’s value to *False* to show it hasn’t been completed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a function to add habits:**\n",
    "- Ask the user for the name of the habit (e.g., “Drink Water”).\n",
    "- Make sure to check if the habit already exists. Display a message if it does.\n",
    "- If it’s new, add it to the dictionary you created to store habits.\n",
    "- For that habit, create a nested dictionary with all 7 days set to *False*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Use ***.strip()*** and ***.title()*** to clean up user input.\n",
    "- **.strip()** = Removes any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the text. People often hit the spacebar by accident and add leading or trailing unwanted spaces. Example: \"  Monday  \" can be fixed by using .strip(): \"Monday\"\"\n",
    "- **.title()** = Capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes the rest lowercase. It helps match formatting exactly (especially for days of the week). Example: \"monday\" or \"MONDAY\"\" will be changed to \"Monday\".\n",
    "- **If the day does not exist, show a helpful error message.**"

    "## Part 3: Marking Tasks and Habits as Complete\n",
    "In this part, you'll implement two functions to allow users to mark their progress: one for tasks and one for habits.\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Create a function to mark tasks as complete:\n",
    "- Display all uncompleted tasks along with the day they belong to.\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter the name of the task they completed.\n",
    "- Find and update the task in your data structure by setting its value to *True*.\n",
    "- If all tasks are completed, display a message saying so.\n",
    "- Make sure to validate the day and check if the task exists. Display a message if the task does not exist or if the day was invalid.\n",
    "- **BONUS:** If the task is from a day before today, print a encouraging or funny message like: \"Task marked as complete. Better late than never!\" **Tip:** You can use the *datetime* library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a function to mark habits as complete:\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter the day and the name of the habit.\n",
    "- Make sure to validate the day and check if the habit exists. Display a message if the habit does not exist or if the day was invalid.\n",
    "- Update the habit’s status for that day by setting its value to *True*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips:\n",
    "- Use **.strip()** and **.title()** to clean up user input.\n",
    "- Always check if the dictionary contains data before trying to access something.\n",
    "- **If the day, habit or task doesn't exist, show a helpful error message.**\n",
